# OctSSH

[中文 README](README.zh.md)

I was just VibeCoding and suddenly thought: **Why can't I just let my agent deploy code to the server for me?**

So, I built **OctSSH**.

![logo](https://github.com/aliyahzombie/OctSSH/raw/main/assets/logo.png)

**OctSSH** is an MCP server that gives LLMs **safe, controllable, and stateful** access to shell environments.

### Note
**By default (stdio mode), OctSSH only connects to machines already configured in your local `ssh_config` for passwordless login.**

> [!TIP]
> **So... what makes OctSSH special?**

## Async Support

OctSSH provides a complete set of async tools to prevent LLMs from timing out on long-running tasks:

| Tool | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `exec(machine, command, confirm_code?)` | Run short commands synchronously |
| `sudo-exec(machine, command, confirm_code?)` | Run synchronously as root (`sudo -n`) |
| `exec-async(machine, command, confirm_code?)` | Run long tasks in background (screen) |
| `exec-async-sudo(...)` | Run background tasks as root |
| `get-result(session_id, lines?)` | Inspect async task output |
| `grep-result(session_id, pattern, ...)` | Search task logs |
| `cancel(session_id)` | Terminate a task |
| `sleep(time)` | Pause (useful for polling) |

> **Note**: In **HTTP Serve mode**, these tools operate directly on the *local* machine, and the `machine` parameter is omitted.

## Security Design

OctSSH features a **Virtual Mode** and **Confirm Code** verification flow:

### 🔒 Safety Mechanism: Virtual Mode

We don't want AI to become a world-ending terminator, so we designed Virtual Mode.
When the AI attempts the following, OctSSH **will not execute immediately**, but instead returns a `confirm_code`:

- 📁 **File Overwrite**: Uploading to a path that already exists.
- 💀 **High-Risk Commands**: `rm -rf` and similar "delete everything" commands.
- 🔍 **Regex Blocklist**: Custom sensitive patterns defined in config.

**Execution Flow Example**:
1. AI calls `exec("web", "rm -rf /var/www/html")`
2. 🛑 OctSSH intercepts: Recursive delete detected -> Returns `confirm_code: a1b2c3` + file impact preview.
3. 👤 User reviews and tells AI: "Confirm execution".
4. ✅ AI calls `exec("web", "rm -rf /var/www/html", "a1b2c3")` -> Actually executes.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @aliyahzombie/octssh
octssh init
```

### Usage Modes

#### 1. Default Client Mode (stdio)
Runs locally and controls remote machines via SSH (reads `~/.ssh/config`):
```bash
octssh
```

#### 2. Streamable HTTP Server Mode (Local Control)
Install this **on the target server**. It exposes the server to LLMs via a secure HTTP interface.
In this mode, OctSSH controls the **local machine** directly (no outbound SSH).

```bash
octssh serve
```
- **Default Listen**: `127.0.0.1:8787` (Override via `OCTSSH_SERVE_HOST` / `OCTSSH_SERVE_PORT`)
- **Auth**: Prints a random key on startup. Clients must send header `X-OctSSH-Key: <key>`.
  - Set fixed key: `export OCTSSH_SERVE_KEY="my-secret"`
- **Tool Changes**: Tools run on *this* machine. **`machine` parameter is omitted**. SSH transfer tools (`upload`/`download`) are disabled.

### MCP Client Configuration

#### General (stdio)
Add to your MCP client config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octssh": {
      "command": "octssh",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Code CLI
```bash
claude mcp add octssh -- octssh
```

#### OpenCode CLI
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "octssh": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "octssh",
      "args": [],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```
Or:
```bash
opencode mcp add octssh --command octssh
```
